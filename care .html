						<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b> Tooth decay and gum disease are caused by plaque, a sticky combination of bacteria and food. Plaque begins to build up on teeth within a few minutes after eating. If teeth are not cleaned well each day, plaque will lead to tooth decay or gum disease. If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become:</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:22px;">•</span> &nbsp Infected</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:22px;">•</span> &nbsp Swollen</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:22px;">•</span> &nbsp Tender</p>
						
						<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b>By taking good care of your teeth and gums, you can help prevent problems such as tooth decay (caries) and gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). You should also teach your children how to brush and floss from an early age to help them protect their teeth.

						<h3>HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH</h3><br>
						<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b>
						Healthy teeth are clean and have no cavities. Healthy gums are pink and firm, and do not bleed. To maintain healthy teeth and gums, follow these steps:
						</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp Floss at least once per day. It is best to floss after brushing. Flossing removes plaque that is left behind after brushing from between the teeth and on the gums.</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Brush for at least 2 minutes each time.</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp Use fluoride toothpaste. The fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel and helps prevent tooth decay.</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp Replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months or sooner if needed. A worn-out toothbrush will not clean your teeth as well. If you use an electric toothbrush, change heads every 3 to 4 months as well. </p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp Eat a healthy diet. You are less likely to get gum disease if you eat healthy foods. </p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp  Avoid sweets and sweetened drinks. Eating and drinking a lot of sweets increases your risk of cavities. If you do eat or drink sweets, brush your teeth soon after.</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp  Do not smoke. Smokers have more teeth and gum problems than non-smokers.</p>
						<p><span style="font-size:18px;">•</span> &nbsp  Keep dentures, retainers, and other appliances clean. This includes brushing them regularly. You may also need to soak them in a cleansing solution.</p>

						<h2>7 Daily Ways to Protect Your Teeth</h2><br>
						<h5>Some say the eyes are the window to the soul. But if you really want to know what someone’s about, check their smile. A welcoming show of pearly whites makes a great first impression, while a tight-lipped smile or whiff of bad breath does the opposite.<br>

                        Read on for tips on how to make sure you’re giving your teeth the care they deserve.</h5>
						<br><br>
						<h5>1.Brush two times a day for two minutes</h5>
						<p>Brush your teeth for two minutes, twice a day, says the American Dental Association (ADA). This will keep your teeth in top form. Brushing your teeth and tongue with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste cleans food and bacteria from your mouth. Brushing also washes out particles that eat away at your teeth and cause cavities.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>2.Don’t overbrush</h5>
						<p>If you brush more than twice a day, for longer than four minutes total, you could wear down the enamel layer that protects your teeth.
                        <br>
When tooth enamel isn’t there, it exposes a layer of dentin. Dentin has tiny holes that lead to nerve endings. When these are triggered, you might feel all sorts of pain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 20 percentTrusted Source of American adults have experienced pain and sensitivity in their teeth.</p>
						<br><br>
						
						<h5>3. A morning brush fights morning breath</h5>
						<p>The mouth is 98.6ºF (37ºC). Warm and wet, it’s filled with food particles and bacteria. These lead to deposits called plaque. When it builds up, it calcifies, or hardens, on your teeth to form tartar, also called calculus. Not only does tartar irritate your gums, it can lead to gum disease as well as cause bad breath.
<br><br>
Be sure to brush in the morning to help get rid of the plaque that’s built up overnight.</p><br><br>

                     <h5>4. Don’t turbocharge</h5>
					 <p>It’s also possible to brush too hard. Brush your teeth like you’re polishing an eggshell. If your toothbrush looks like someone sat on it, you’re applying too much pressure.

Enamel is strong enough to protect teeth from everything that goes on inside your mouth, from eating and drinking to beginning the digestive process. Children and teens have softer enamel than adults, leaving their teeth more prone to cavities and erosion from food and drink.</p><br><br>

                    <h5>5. Make sure you floss every day</h5>
					<p>Want to avoid minimal scraping at your next checkup? Flossing loosens the particles that brushing misses. It also removes plaque, and in so doing prevents the buildup of tartar. While it’s easy to brush plaque away, you need a dentist to remove tartar.</p>
					</div><br><br>
					
					<h5>6. It doesn’t matter when you do it</h5>
					<p>You finally have an answer to the age-old question: “Which comes first, flossing or brushing?” It doesn’t matter, according to the ADA, as long as you do it every day.</p><br><br>
					
					<h5>7. Stay away from soda</h5>
					<p>“Sip All Day, Get Decay” is a campaign from the Minnesota Dental Association to warn people of the dangers of soft drinks. It’s not just sugar soda, but diet soda, too, that harms teeth. The acid in soda attacks teeth. Once acid eats away at enamel, it goes on to create cavities, leaves stains on the tooth surface, and erodes the inside structure of the tooth. To avoid drinking-related tooth decay, limit soft drinks and take good care of your teeth.</p>
